## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Harish Kumar Sarathi, a data-driven problem solver currently pursuing my Master’s at **UT Dallas**. I specialize in translating business needs into analytical solutions using a blend of classical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-native technologies.

With a background in Electronics & IoT and hands-on experience across **Python, R, SQL, AWS**, and **Power BI**, I’ve delivered solutions in **customer behavior modeling**, **NLP-driven risk analysis**, **recommendation systems**, and **cloud-based data platforms**.

I thrive at the intersection of **experimentation**, **problem-solving**, and **business value creation**-always ready to collaborate, iterate, and deliver measurable impact.
